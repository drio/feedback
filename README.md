# drio/feedback

I wanted to have a place to discuss topics covered in my [blog](http://drio.github.com)
and I thought what Zach's [approach](https://github.com/holman/feedback) was pretty
cool.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/drio/feedback/issues/new) on this
project.

I will be closing the questions but you can still keep asking questions there.
